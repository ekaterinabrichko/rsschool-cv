3. > I've been working as a QA Engineer for a year now (Mobile and Web). I could say that I'm more self-educated in that. I've read a tone of information about QA. During that time I've discovered interest not only in finding bugs but also in fixing them. All the time I want to dive deeper to solve the issue on my own. Unfortunately, I don't have programming experience (only Pascal at school :D), but I do wanna learn. That's why I'm here. I've decided to start with iOS development first.
4. Languages: Pascal (at school), js (beginner)
Methodologies: Scrum/Kanban
Version control: Git
Tools: Charles Proxy, Postman
5. Code:
```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
6. Beginner with programming (_**confused**_)

End of table.

8. Level: **Upper intermediate**.
I have been using English almost everyday for more than 5 years.
Previously it was helpful while I was working as a **Junior Reaserch fellow** at National Academy of science: reading scientific articles, guides, instructions (how to use equipment, conducting experiments).
Then I was working as a **Support specialist**. I communicated with dental distributors, and customers by phone (from America), email and chats communication.
As a **QA engineer** I'm creating bug reports in English, communicate with French teammates.
_**Conclusion**_: oral and written experience.
